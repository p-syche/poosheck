## How to run

Feel free to clone or fork this repo. Once you have it you can use either

```
react-native run-ios
```

or

```
react-native run-android
```

to run the app in your emulator.

## The tech stack

This version of Poosheck is written in React Native only. It uses the following dependencies:
- React Navigation: https://reactnavigation.org/
- React Native Async Storage: https://github.com/react-native-async-storage/async-storage
- React Native SVG: https://github.com/react-native-svg/react-native-svg


## The weather

In order to display the current weather, Poosheck asks the Open Weather API: https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api

## To be added:
- Animated rain
- A better localization
- Reading the weather out loud
- Connect the app to Google Assistant
